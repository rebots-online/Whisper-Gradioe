# Project Resume: Multi-Tenant Implementation for Whisper-WebUI

## Project Overview

We are implementing a multi-tenant reseller panel for the Whisper-WebUI project, which will allow resellers to manage their own customers while sharing a common backend. The implementation will use Flowise (which includes React Flow) for the frontend workflow builder and integrate with RevenueCat for subscription management.

## Current Status

We have completed the initial architecture design and the foundation setup, including:

1. **Database Schema Design**: Created a comprehensive multi-tenant database schema with tables for resellers, tenants, users, workflows, jobs, etc.

2. **SQL Migration Scripts**: Developed scripts for creating the multi-tenant tables and migrating existing data.

3. **Tenant Context Middleware**: Implemented middleware for extracting tenant information from authentication tokens and adding it to request state.

4. **Authentication System**: Created a JWT-based authentication system with support for reseller, tenant, and user roles.

5. **Branding System Integration**: Reviewed the existing branding system from RobinsAI.World-Admin and documented the integration approach.

The project is now ready to move to the next phase: implementing the job management and polling system.

## Key Components

1. **Multi-Tenant Backend**: Modify the existing Whisper-WebUI FastAPI backend to support tenant isolation and context.

2. **Flowise/React Flow Integration**: Implement a visual workflow builder using Flowise or React Flow for creating transcription pipelines.

3. **Job Polling System**: Create a robust job management system with real-time updates via WebSockets and fallback polling.

4. **Reseller Panel**: Develop a comprehensive reseller dashboard for managing customers, subscriptions, and workflows.

5. **RevenueCat Integration**: Implement subscription management with RevenueCat for handling payments and feature access.

6. **Branding System Integration**: Integrate with the existing branding system from RobinsAI.World-Admin to support white-labeling.

## Next Steps

1. **Design Job Queue System**: Create a job queue system with tenant isolation for processing transcription jobs.

2. **Implement Real-Time Job Updates**: Set up a WebSocket server for real-time job status updates with tenant isolation.

3. **Create Job Polling Fallback**: Implement REST API endpoints for job status polling as a fallback mechanism.

4. **Integrate Flowise/React Flow**: Begin integration of Flowise or React Flow for the workflow builder interface.

5. **Develop Reseller Panel**: Create the reseller dashboard for managing customers, subscriptions, and workflows.

## Technical Decisions

1. **Flowise vs. Pure React Flow**: We are evaluating whether to use Flowise (which includes React Flow) or implement directly with React Flow. Flowise provides more out-of-the-box functionality but may require more customization for our specific needs.

2. **Job Status Updates**: We will implement a dual approach with WebSockets for real-time updates and REST API polling as a fallback mechanism.

3. **Tenant Isolation**: We will use a combination of database-level isolation (separate rows with tenant IDs) and application-level isolation (tenant context in all operations).

4. **Branding System**: We will integrate with the existing branding system from RobinsAI.World-Admin rather than creating a new one.

## Hardware Considerations

The system is being designed to work with:

- RTX 4090 Mobile GPU with 16GB VRAM
- RTX 3000 series GPUs
- Datacenter GPUs (K80 and up)

The implementation will include automatic detection and configuration based on the available hardware.

## Open Questions

1. **Flowise vs. React Flow**: Should we use Flowise (which includes React Flow) or implement directly with React Flow?

2. **Resource Allocation**: How should we allocate GPU resources between tenants to ensure fair usage?

3. **Scaling Strategy**: What is the best approach for scaling the system as the number of tenants grows?

4. **Data Migration**: How will we handle data migration for existing users to the new multi-tenant system?

5. **Backup and Recovery**: What strategy should we implement for backup and recovery in a multi-tenant environment?

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Foundation Setup)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Job Management)**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Reseller Panel)**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Customer Portal)**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 5 (RevenueCat Integration)**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 6 (Whisper-WebUI Integration)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 7 (Testing and Deployment)**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 8 (Documentation and Training)**: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated timeline: 17-20 weeks
